# capstone_code
Old code from my capstone project team. Built on ROS (https://www.ros.org/).

This code reads position data from a LeapMotion hand tracker and uses it as the desired endpoint for our robot, then runs the generated IK solution to get joint angles.

My largest contribution to this was the robot definition files and models - these were necessary for the simulation to be accurate so the real-world mapping would be correct.
